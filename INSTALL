Prerequisites
=============

You will need to have installed the following software. Header
files (-dev or -devel packages) of the following libraries are
also needed to compile libnetconf.

- libxml2
  http://xmlsoft.org

- libssh2
  Version 1.2.9 or greater is recomended.
  http://www.libssh2.org

  To disable usage of the libssh2, use:

  $ ./configure --disable-libssh2

  In such a case, libnetconf will use standalone ssh(1) client
  application to connect NETCONF client to the NETCONF server.
  ssh(1) is available as a part of the OpenSSH.

- DBus
  libdbus version 1.0.0 or greater
  http://dbus.freedesktop.org

  DBus is required by the NETCONF Notifications subsystem. If the
  Notifications support is switched off, DBus is no more needed:

  $ ./configure --disable-notifications


If compiling including the example implementations of a server
and a client you will also need:

- libevent
  version 2.0.x
  http://libevent.org

- libreadline
  http://www.gnu.org/software/readline/


The remaining items are optional.

- doxygen
  Used to generate documentation from the source code.
  Version 1.8.0 or greater is recommended.
  http://www.doxygen.org

- rpmbuild
  Used to build RPM package.
  http://www.rpm.org


Building / Installation
=======================

To install libnetconf with default options:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

This way the library will be installed in /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/include respectively. Configure can have many
options specified, to show them all use:

$ ./configure --help

For instance, to build and install libnetconf with the examples:

$ ./configure --with-examples
$ make
# make install

This will include all the examples in the build process and
then copy them to /usr/local/bin/ as netconf-server, netconf-client
and netconf-events. Also, the directories /usr/share/libnetconf/server/
and /usr/share/libnetconf/streams/ are created because they are
required by netconf-server. For more information about the examples
refer to README in ./examples.


SSH Server Settings
-------------------

By default, libnetconf connects to a NETCONF server via port 830.
To allow this connection, you should set SSH server to listen on
port 830 (it listens on port 22 by default) and add apropriate rule
to your firewall.

On the server side, libnetconf expects that the application is 
invoked as an SSH Subsystem by the SSH server. In case of the OpenSSH
SSH daemon, user have to add following line to the sshd configuration
(/etc/ssh/sshd_config):

Subsystem netconf <path to the NETCONF agent application>
