libnetconf's functions to use TLS 

These functions are experimental\&. It is possible, that TLS transport (and mainly certificates management) is not fully implemented in this version\&.
.PP
Remember, that to make these functions available, libnetconf must be compiled with --enable-tls configure's option\&.

.SS "int nc_tls_init (const char *peer_cert, const char *peer_key, const char *CAfile, const char *CApath)"

.PP
Set paths to the client certificate and its private key\&. This function takes effect only on client side\&. It must be used before establishing NETCONF session (including call home) over TLS\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIpeer_cert\fP Path to the file containing client certificate 
.br
\fIpeer_key\fP Path to the file containing private key for the client certificate\&. If NULL, key is expected to be stored in the file specified in cert parameter\&. 
.br
\fICAfile\fP Location of the CA certificate used to verify the server certificates\&. For More info, see documentation for SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() function from OpenSSL\&. 
.br
\fICApath\fP Location of the CA certificates used to verify the server certificates\&. For More info, see documentation for SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() function from OpenSSL\&.
