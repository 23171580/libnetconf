.SS "Cloning git repository"
.PP
As written on libnetconfs \fCGoogle Code page\fP the repository can be cloned using following command:
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ git clone https://code\&.google\&.com/p/libnetconf/
.fi

.SS "Compilation"
.PP
libnetconf uses standard GNU Autotools toolchain\&. To compile and install libnetconf you have to go through the following three steps:
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ \&./configure
$ make
# make install
.fi
.PP
.PP
This way the library will be installed in \fC/usr/local/lib/\fP (or lib64) and \fC/usr/local/include/\fP respectively\&.
.PP
.SS "Configure Options"
.PP
\fCconfigure\fP script supports the following options\&. The full list of the accepted options can be shown by \fC--help\fP option\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC--disable--ssh2\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Remove dependency on the \fClibssh2\fP library\&. By default, the \fClibssh2\fP library is used by the client side functions to create SSH connection to a remote host\&. If the usage of the \fClibssh2\fP is disabled, libnetconf will use a standalone \fCssh(1)\fP client located in a system path\&. \fCssh(1)\fP client is, for example, part of the OpenSSH\&.

\fC--with-suid=<user>\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Limit usage of the libnetconf to the specific \fIuser\fP\&. With this option, libnetconf creates shared files and other resources with access rights limited to the specified \fIuser\fP\&. This option can be freely combined with the \fC--with-sgid\fP option\&. If neither \fC--with-suid\fP nor \fC--with-sgid\fP option is specified, full access rights for all users are granted\&.

Limit usage of the libnetconf to the specific \fIgroup\fP\&. With this option, libnetconf creates shared files and other resources with access rights limited to the specified \fIgroup\fP\&. This option can be freely combined with the \fC--with-suid\fP option\&. If neither \fC--with-suid\fP nor \fC--with-sgid\fP option is specified, full access rights for all users are granted\&.

\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
If the library is built with \fC--with-suid\fP or \fC--with-sgid\fP options, the proper suid or/and sgid bit should be properly set to the server-side application binaries using the libnetconf library\&. An example of such settings can be seen on the example server application\&.

\fC--with-examples\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Besides the libnetconf library, build also example applications located in the \fCexamples/\fP subdirectory\&. Examples include NETCONF client, NETCONF server and NETCONF Notifications reader\&.
