Here is a description of using libnetconf functions in a NETCONF client:
.IP "1." 4
\fBSet verbosity (optional)\fP\&.
.br
 The verbosity of the libnetconf can be set by \fBnc_verbosity()\fP\&. By default, libnetconf is completely silent\&.
.br
 There is a default message printing function writing messages on the stderr\&. The application's specific message printing function can be set via \fBnc_callback_print()\fP function\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fBSet SSH authentication methods priorities (optional)\fP\&.
.br
 libnetconf supports several SSH authentication methods for connecting to a NETCONF server over SSH\&. However, the used method is selected from a list of supported authentication methods provided by the server\&. Client is allowed to specify the priority of each supported authentication method via \fBnc_ssh_pref()\fP function\&. The authentication method can also be disabled using a negative priority value\&.
.br
 Default priorities are following:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fIInteractive\fP (value 3)
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fIPassword\fP (value 2)
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fIPublic keys\fP (value 1)
.PP

.IP "3." 4
\fBSet own callback(s) for the SSH authentication methods (optional)\fP\&.
.br
 User credentials are received via the callback functions specific for each authentication method\&. There are default callbacks, but application can set their own via:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fIInteractive\fP - nc_callback_sshauth_interactive()
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fIPassword\fP - nc_callback_sshauth_password()
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fIPubluc keys\fP - nc_callback_sshauth_passphrase()\&. Here can also the paths to the key files be specified by nc_set_publickey_path() and nc_set_privatekey_path()\&. If not set, libnetconf tries to find them in the default paths\&.
.PP

.IP "4." 4
\fBConnect to the NETCONF server(s)\fP\&.
.br
 Simply call \fBnc_session_connect()\fP to connect to the specified host via SSH\&. Authentication method is selected according to the default values or the previous steps\&.
.IP "5." 4
\fBPrepare NETCONF rpc message(s)\fP\&.
.br
 Creating NETCONF rpc messages is covered by the functions described in the section \fBNETCONF rpc\fP\&. The application prepares NETCONF rpc messages according to the specified attributes\&. These messages can be then repeatedly used for communication over any of the created NETCONF sessions\&.
.IP "6." 4
\fBSend the message to the selected NETCONF server\fP\&.
.br
 To send created NETCONF rpc message to the NETCONF server, use \fBnc_session_send_rpc()\fP function\&. \fBnc_session_send_recv()\fP function connects sending and receiving the reply (see the next step) into one blocking call\&.
.IP "7." 4
\fBGet the server's rpc-reply message\fP\&. When the NETCONF rpc is sent, use \fBnc_session_recv_reply()\fP to receive the reply\&. To learn when the reply is coming, a file descriptor of the communication channel can be checked by poll(), select(), \&.\&.\&. This descriptor can be obtained via \fBnc_session_get_eventfd()\fP function\&.
.IP "8." 4
\fBClose the NETCONF session\fP\&.
.br
 When the communication is finished, the NETCONF session is closed by \fBnc_session_close()\fP and all the used structures are freed by \fBnc_session_free()\fP\&.
.IP "9." 4
\fBFree all created objects\fP\&.
.br
 Do not forget to free created rpc messages (\fBnc_rpc_free()\fP), \fBfilters\fP (\fBnc_filter_free()\fP) or received NETCONF rpc-replies (\fBnc_reply_free()\fP)\&.
