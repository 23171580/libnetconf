libnetconf's Example Server Configuration
=========================================

netconf-server(1) expects a configuration data model (model.yin) in this
directory. The file is expected to contain configuration data in YIN
format. This directory also contain datastore.xml file with the content
of the configuration datastores. If the file does not exist, it is
automatically created with no content.
