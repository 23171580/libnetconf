/**
 * \page datastores Datastores Usage
 *
 * NETCONF defines usage of three datastores: running (mandatory),
 * startup (optional via :startup capability) and candidate (optional via
 * :candidate capability). libnetconf provides all these datastores.
 *
 * In addition to the described NETCONF point of view, libnetconf divides all
 * datastores (running, startup and candidate) into datastore parts connected
 * with a specific (basic) configuration data model. Each datastore part is
 * created by ncds_new() or ncds_new_transapi() function. According to the
 * specified datastore type, server should set up additional datastore settings
 * (see sections below). Finnaly, to activate datastore and to get its unique
 * identifier, ncds_init() function must be called.
 *
 * If you want to use some data model that extends (by import or augment
 * statement) any of the used data models, functions ncds_add_model() or
 * ncds_add_models_path() can be used to specify location of the extension data
 * model(s).
 *
 * By default, all features defined in configuration data models are disabled.
 * To enable specific features or all features at once, you can use
 * ncds_feature_enable() and ncds_features_enableall() functions.
 *
 * To finish changes made to the datastores (adding augment data models,
 * enabling and disabling features, etc.), server must call ncds_consolidate()
 * function.
 *
 * As a next step, device controlled by the server should be initialized. This
 * should includes copying startup configuration data into the running
 * datastore (and applying them to the current device settings).
 *
 * ## Datastore Settings ##
 *
 * - Empty Datastore (*NCDS_TYPE_EMPTY*)
 *
 *   There is no additional settings for this datastore type.
 *
 * - \ref fileds (*NCDS_TYPE_FILE*)
 *
 *   ncds_file_set_path() to set file to store datastore content.
 *
 * - \ref customds (*NCDS_TYPE_CUSTOM*)
 *
 *   This type of datastore implementation is provided by the server, not by
 *   libnetconf.
 *
 *   ncds_custom_set_data() sets server specific functions implementing the
 *   datastore. In this case, server is required to implement functions
 *   from #ncds_custom_funcs structure.
