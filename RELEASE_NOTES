libnetconf 0.5.0

This release includes the following changes:

 * Transaction API (TransAPI) including code templates generator. For more
   information, see documentation.
 * Support for augmented configuration data models.
 * Support for grouping/uses statements in configuration data models.
 * Support for using multiple SSH channels.
 * Allow switching on/off of data model features.
 * Better separation of libssh2 - for servers or simple clients it is no more
   needed to link libssh2, libnetconf will use it on its own.
 * The way of setting up Recovery session UID changed - instead of function
   nacm_recovery_uid(), the configure's --with-nacm-recovery-uid option must be
   used.
 * Higher granularity of nc_init()'s flags - various libnetconf's subsystems
   including internal data store set can be switched off now. By default, caller
   is supposed to use NC_INIT_ALL flag to initiate libnetconf with all its
   subsystems.
 * Allow linking libnetconf from a C++ code.
 * Set of new functions:
   ncds_apply_rpc2all()
     - Apply RPC to all managed data stores and automatically compound resulting
       reply.
   ncntf_stream_info()
     - Get basic information about the Event Stream.
