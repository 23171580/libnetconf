   Implementation of the NACM is provided via an internal datastore.
 * Support for SUID and SGID applications

   libnetconf supports placing of items of the YANG list and leaf-list
   types into the specified position inside the list (RFC 6020,
   sections 7.7.7 and 7.8.6).
 * Support for editing YANG's choice type
   libnetconf automatically maintain configuration data of the YANG
   choice type (RFC 6020, section 7.9.6).
 * Support for using ssh(1) instead of libssh2 on the client side
 * Support for building source in external directory
 * Support for building libnetconf without the Notifications subsystem
   As a side effect, this option removes dependency for DBus.
